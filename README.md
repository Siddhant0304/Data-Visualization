# Visualization of the effects of covid 19 in hospitalization in new York state


1.	Project Description:

The primary data set is county wise data of hospitalization due to COVID-19 in the New York state for the year 2021. The secondary data set includes total number of tests performed and number of people who tested positive for COVID 19. For this project, we are considering two counties, namely Bronx and Erie. 
All facility names, facility network, number of patients admitted, discharged and expired, hospital staff and beds available, and patients’ age groups, are represented in the primary data set. Secondary data set includes total number of tests performed, number of positive results and COVID 19 positivity percentage as per different counties. We aim to compare healthcare services provided among these counties and how did COVID 19 affect people of 20-44 age groups using data visualization techniques. 

2.	Objective:

These data sets will be used to visualize and determine which county provides better hospital services by considering factors like the number of staff, number of beds, ICU wards, etc., and the effect of COVID 19 in Bronx and Erie counties of New York state during the time of COVID 19 in 2021.

3.	Hypothesis:

###### •	Whether the People in Bronx County are less likely to get affected by COVID-19 than People in Erie County.
### •	Does age group 20- 44 are hospitalized less as compared to age group 55 -64 because of younger age.
### •	Whether INDEPENDENT hospital network in Erie County have less treatment scale than CATHOLIC HEALTH network and KALEIDA HEALTH network.
### •	Does less hospitalization happening in second quarter in Bronx County as compared to first quarter because better prevention measures have been taken.
### •	Whether patients in ICU are more likely to expire in Bronx County as compared to Erie County.
### •	Whether patients affected by COVID are more likely to expire in Bronx County as compared to Erie County.

Secondary Dataset: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e/data

5.	Records:

•	In the primary Data set we have 171K Rows and 37 columns.
•	In the secondary data set we have 67.8K Rows and 8 columns.


6.	Visualization: 

In order to get reliable visualization, we will first clean the dataset using python.
Further, we will be using Tableau as our visualization tool due to its salient features like:
•	Intuitive dashboard with ability to create representations simply using drag and drop.
•	Ability of the Tableau to recommend and select best visualization based on data and attributes selected.
•	Capability to work with multiple data sources and handle large datasets.
•	Easy to try multiple visualization types and choose one that best serves the interests.
